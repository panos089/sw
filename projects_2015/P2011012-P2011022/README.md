<h3>Twitter and Google News based D3.js visualization on political events<h3>

A force layout visualization on current "Hot" events. Data source will be twitter search content based on Google news headlines.
The nodes will represent each entity's political origin ,the entity itself and the tweets posted for it respectively. The entire 
visualization is in realtime and it is also storing it's snapshots periodically. That said the user will be able to scroll through days and hours and construct the news diagram through time.

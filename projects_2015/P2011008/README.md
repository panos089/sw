<h3>_Web visualization app based on news spread via twitter_<h3>

In more detail the visualization will represent the flow of news posted by official twitter accounts of big news corporations,
such as BBC , CNN and others.The flow of information will be represented by directional vectors on a world map.It should be noted the there will be an noticeable correlation between the 
users doing the retweets and the followers of the news corporation by which the tweet was posted, that feature will add an extra
functionality to the visualization , namely the geographical representation of the active followers the posting corporation has.
